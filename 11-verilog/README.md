# Verilog

> Verilog, standardized as IEEE 1364, is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems. It is most commonly used in the design and verification of digital circuits at the register-transfer level of abstraction.

I'm using [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com) and [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim) to write and compile Verilog code and design digital logic circuits.
